Before you run this project save your firebase config file in config.js

This is a Vue.js project using Firebase as backend for managing digitization of data from images. Though it is not optimized or even complete in UI design, it is a good starting point for someone interested to implement similar project.

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev
